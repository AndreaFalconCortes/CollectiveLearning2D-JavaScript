This readme.txt provides the necessary information to run the code program inside this repository.

This program code is the same code with what we obtained the results (in 2d dynamics) in the paper titled "Lévy movements and slowly decaying memory allow efficient collective learning in groups of interacting foragers" written by Andrea Falcón-Cortés, Denis Boyer, Maximino Aldana, and Gabriel Ramos-Fernández and sent to the journal PLoS Computational Biology, for the first time, at 05/02/2023. Andrea Falcón-Cortés wrote all the code. Especial acknowledges to A. Aldana, for fruitful discussions.
